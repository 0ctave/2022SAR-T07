    "This REST web server provides simple functionality related to generating *random integers* in a given *range*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API of the server is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `GET` `/random_range`\n",
    "Returns the current random integer *range* (should be \\[1, 10\\] by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON response content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'from_n': 1,\n",
    "  'to_n': 10\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "but the values `1` and `10` may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the default parameters the URL you need to provide to the `requests` library is of the form: `'http://127.0.0.1:8891/random_range'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `GET` `/random_number`\n",
    "Returns a new generated random integer *number* each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON response content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'number': 7\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "but the value `7` may be different and should usually change from request to request.\n",

    "With the default parameters the URL you need to provide to the `requests` library is of the form: `'http://127.0.0.1:8891/random_number'`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `POST` `/random_range`\n",
    "Takes a new random integer range as input, sets it to be used in future requests and returns the new current random integer *range*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON request *body* content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'from_n': 5,\n",
    "  'to_n': 100\n",
