    "## Context\n",
    "\n",
    "This REST web server provides simple functionality related to generating *random integers* in a given *range*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The API of the server is:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `GET` `/random_range` (identical to version in Session03)\n",
    "Returns the current random integer *range* (should be \\[1, 10\\] by default).\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON response content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'from_n': 1,\n",
    "  'to_n': 10\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "but the values `1` and `10` may be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the default parameters the URL you need to provide to the `requests` library is of the form: `'http://127.0.0.1:8891/random_range'`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `GET` `/random_number`  (**additions** to version in Session03)\n",
    "Returns a new generated random integer *number* each time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON response content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'number': 7\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "but the value `7` may be different and should usually change from request to request.\n",
    "There are two possible **query parameters**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `count` : (type: int), default=1000\n",
    "  * How many random numbers should be returned in the *streaming* response\n",
    "* `intervalms` : (type: int), default=-1\n",
    "  * How many milliseconds to wait between returning streaming random numbers. Setting to `-1` means a random delay\n",
    "\n",
    "With the default parameters the URL you need to provide to the `requests` library is of the form: `'http://127.0.0.1:8891/random_number'`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `POST` `/random_range` (identical to version in Session03)\n",
    "Takes a new random integer range as input, sets it to be used in future requests and returns the new current random integer *range*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON request *body* content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'from_n': 5,\n",
    "  'to_n': 100\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The JSON response content is of the form:\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  'from_n': 5,\n",
    "  'to_n': 100\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "but the values `5` and `100` may be different. Normally, the provided range as input should be the same as the one returned, but if an error has occurred the new range may not have been updated.\n",
    "Check the response to make sure it is up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the default parameters the URL you need to provide to the `requests` library is of the form: `'http://127.0.0.1:8891/random_range'`"
